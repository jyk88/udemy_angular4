<!--
hints
- because servers.component.html really only references
server.component.html, and this component only really looks at
server.component.css, you must apply styling to
server.component.css and reference it in styleUrl in
server.component.ts file.

- you can bind html properties to boolean values (i.e. allowNewServer)
in ts, the constructor calls for timeout to allow the value to be true after 2 seconds
so it's disabled until 2 seconds later

- can pass in string interpolation as {{ xyz }} OR pass it in as an HTML attribute using [innerText] = "xyz"
$event : is a reserved variable name used for event binding
->$event variable data emitted with that event
can be like input or click "type" of event.

what are directives?
- instructions in the DOM! components are kind of directives in the DOM..
- we are asking angular to add component

*ngIf is a directive available to us straight out of the box
it can take in true/false just like property binding, but can also take in else statements
wherein you define what happens if the first desired output isn't true
you denote it by using hashtag (#), then calling "else xyz". make sure you have an #xyz that shows up
somewhere in the code.
it's not super common but you can do it.
